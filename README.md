# Sample Build Pipeline for Demonstration

![Pipeline Structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpcsc/sample-pipeline/master/sample-pipeline.png "Pipeline Structure")

This is the sample pipeline that I used to demonstrate build pipeline and some CD practices like pipeline as code

The pipeline refers to 3 Git repositories:
- [https://github.com/hpcsc/sample-pipeline-backend](https://github.com/hpcsc/sample-pipeline-backend): backend build scripts and pipeline code
- [https://github.com/hpcsc/sample-pipeline-mobile](https://github.com/hpcsc/sample-pipeline-mobile): mobile build scripts and pipeline code
- [https://github.com/hpcsc/sample-pipeline-system-tests](https://github.com/hpcsc/sample-pipeline-system-tests): system tests build scripts and pipeline code
